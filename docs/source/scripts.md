# Scripts

This is a placeholder for the scripts documentation.
All the scripts should be documented here.

Notice that this file is written in Markdown.
This is doable because the `myst_parser` extension is enabled in the `conf.py` file.

## example_01.py

This is an example script.

## example_02.py

This is another example script.
